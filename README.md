4904matter
==============
4904's standard formatter file for Eclipse.

This formatter is intended to be loaded into Eclipse in Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter (Import).

It will automatically format your code to the standard 4904 format.

Please also enable automatic formatting on save in Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Save Actions (Format all lines).

This will prevent accidentally committing without formatting first.
